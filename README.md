ChromaKeyer
===========
ChromaKeyer is an application for removing colored background from still images. It was initially written in 2017 as an in-house tool in Gafarov Bros. Studio in the process of making a short animated film "Mishka" (http://mishka-film.blogspot.ru). In 2018 it was improved and released as Open Source.

ChromaKeyer is written in D using OpenGL, [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org), [NativeFileDialog](https://github.com/mlabbe/nativefiledialog) and [dlib](https://github.com/gecko0307/dlib). It also uses some components from [Dagon](https://github.com/gecko0307/dagon).
